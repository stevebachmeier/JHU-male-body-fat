# Body fat (male) Shiny app

The app can be found online at: https://stevebachmeier.shinyapps.io/maleBodyFat3Fold/

This is the final project for the Developing Data Products course in the Johns Hopkins University data science specialization. The goal was to create and host an app on Shiny's platform.

## Description

This is an R shiny app that takes user skin fold measurements and calculates the body fat percentage and plots it over time. At this time, it only works for male users. More details can be found at the app itself.
